1 double for loops
-> two pointer
-> find two max: keep bigger move smaller
-> 11.ContainerWithMostWater

2 Greedy algorithm
-> A Greedy algorithm is an algorithm that makes the best possible decision at the current time;
-> 12. Integer to Roman -> in this case taking out the largest possible symbol it can.

3 Edge
-> when input is String[], notice [],[""],["a"],["ab","a"],["flower","flower","flower","flower"]

4 Pro. 19 Remove Nth Node From End of List
-> two pointers move together to calculate the Nth Node From End.
  We maintain this constant gap by advancing both pointers together until the first pointer arrives past the last node.
   The second pointer will be pointing at the nnth node counting from the last

5 Pro.22 Amazing recursion and backtrack

6 Pro.23 Approach 5: Merge with Divide And Conquer --> merge each pair

7 Pro.42 Approach 2: Dynamic Programming amazing!!!! -->
"In brute force, we iterate over the left and right parts again and again just to find the highest bar size upto that index.
 But, this could be stored. Voila, dynamic programming."
 -->4 approaches show how to improve an algorithm from brute force. Important!!!!
